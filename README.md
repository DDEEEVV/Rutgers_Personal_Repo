>Two weeks after Pandas Library and the material that I have learned so far has been fascinating. The power of APIs have shocked me and at the same time have made me love the industry even more.
The fact that I have been using and understanding APIs is awesome. Isn't it amazing, having this very powerful tool in the palm of your hand has glued me to my work station.
This week we are working and learning PyViz. PyViz is a coordinated effort to make data visualization in Python easier to use, learn and more powerful. PyViz consists of a set of open-source Python packages to work effortlessly with both small and large datasets right in the web browsers.
