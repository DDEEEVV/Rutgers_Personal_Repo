# *DC_Python_HomeWork*

### In this activity, I worked on a Python script and analyzed the financial records of a company. 

### Based on the financial dataset in this file: 

>>>>***[budget_csv_data](../DC_Python_HomeWork/PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv)***

### I worked on and calculated all the tasks by running this code that can be found by clicking below:

>>>>**[Davit_Cuedari_HW](../DC_Python_HomeWork/PyBank/main.ipynb)**

*My task was to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:*

The total number of months included in the dataset.

The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.
