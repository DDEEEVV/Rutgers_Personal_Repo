 ## Instructions

 Answer the following questions:

   * What does FinTech mean to you? Why is it important?
For me FinTech is the application of the finance through technology, a combination that keeps up with the needs and the evolution of technology making it more accessible and easy for everyone. It also opens new windows for people to create and bring new products to find that financial freedom.

   * What about FinTech interests you?
FinTech interests me to learn more and be available to compete in a world where this new order is emerging because of the technology involvement in every sector.
   * Where do you expect FinTech to take you? What are you looking to do?
I expect to learn a lot in this course and to be able to put my ideas and imagination into a real world. I want to learn about crypto and blockchain and use it to make and receive payments.
   * What about FinTech may be confusing? What makes sense?
It makes sense when it comes to the comfy of using it, when using an online brokerage app and being able to trade with Robinhood for example it feels like you also are participating into this very advance fintech world we live in. 
 Write down your answers and keep them somewhere safe. In the future, we will look back at your responses to see how much you've accomplished!
