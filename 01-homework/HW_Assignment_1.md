## *Overview and Origin*

>*Cubic Transportation Systems* is a San Diego based company that created OMNY system, the new tap-and-go contacttless fare payment system designed for New Yorker's Metropolitan Authority (MTA).

>Founded in 1949 by Walter Zable in San Diego, California as an electronic Company it began operations in 1951. The company was named Cubic to reflect both the engineering and precision aspect, it became a publicly-traded company in 1959.

> The MTA announced in 2016 that would start to design and find a new way of contactless fare payment to replace the old method of payment throught MetroCards. This idea of replacing the payment system was originaly planned for partial implementation in 2018 and full implementation by 2022. The MTA first started experimenting in 2017 a system called eTix-compatible which was a contacless payment through phone desigend for MTA employees only. 

>In the early 2000s, MTA ran trials of contactless payments on several subway stations in Manhattan. These pilots affirmed the technology’s potential, and in 2016 MTA began planning to sunset the MetroCard and replace it with a contactless system. This would be no small task; MTA would have to redesign its payment system to be account-based—allowing each passenger to maintain his or her own “digital payment account” — while installing near-field communications payment terminals and optical scanners throughout its network. Cubic Transportation Systems received a $500 million contract to build this system, which would ultimately be called OMNY (short for One Metro New York). 

>In March 2019, more than 12,000 readers were installed all over New York City's subway system and busses. Before its launch that March $85.4 million have been spent on the project, out of a total budget of $644.7 million. As of 2020 the budget has risen to $732 million by November 2020 and $772 million by June 2021.

## *Business Activities*

>As the world advances and less and less people use cash and carry cash, the subway system in New York City was the only system left behind, not to just compare it with the other FinTech inovations around the city but also with the rest of the world. OMNY is going to save time and make it easier to pay and never worry about refilling the MetroCard again, just tap and go. It is an easy way that can receive payments from smartphones, smartwatches and credit cards that have the wireless payment option.

>The returning customers in a postpandemic world started using the public transportation again and finaly MTA was able to generade data about the traffic of public transportation use, a sector that was hit hard by the pandemic. In May 2021 MTA realesed the information that the NYC subway and buss rides reached a pandemic record high rideship of 2,239,500 contactless transactions in one single day. As of today speaking there are 472 subway stations and 5,800 MTA busses that offer the OMNY contactless payment to use the public transportation in NYC.

## *Landscape*

>One of the largest domains of FinTech in terms of interest from investors is payments. Payment is about payment services including payment back-end infrastracture, card issuing, merchant acquiring, mobile payment, seamless solutions and point of sales solution. OMNY is in the domain of payments that can be considered as a payment, back-end and infrastructure. 
This subdomain of payments can broadly refers to payment processing providers, solutions for accepting electronic payments, point of sale terminals, and card providers and also mobile payments. 

>The last 20 years have shapen the world when it comes to how we pay for goods and serices. It started with PayPal and WorldPay that kicked off the first wave of FinTech, making it easier for buyers and sellers to do business together in internet and in person. This last decade has proven that we have been using the digital payment services in almost 90% of our daily transactions thanx to RFID (radio-frequency identification) and mobile apps, the industry is projected to be worth $2 trillion by 2025.
