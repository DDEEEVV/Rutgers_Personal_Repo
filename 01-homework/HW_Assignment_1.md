## *Overview and Origin*

>*Cubic Transportation Systems* is a San Diego - based company that created the OMNY system, the new tap-and-go contactless fare payment system designed for New Yorker's Metropolitan Authority (MTA).

>Founded in 1949 by Walter Zable in San Diego, California as an electronic Company it began operations in 1951. The company was named Cubic to reflect both the engineering and precision aspect, it became a publicly-traded company in 1959.

> The MTA announced in 2016 that would start to design and find a new way of contactless fare payment to replace the old method of payment through MetroCards. This idea of replacing the payment system was originally planned for partial implementation in 2018 and full implementation by 2022. The MTA first started experimenting in 2017 with a system called eTix-compatible which was a contactless payment through phone designed for MTA employees only. 

>In the early 2000s, MTA ran trials of contactless payments on several subway stations in Manhattan. These pilots affirmed the technology’s potential, and in 2016 MTA began planning to sunset the MetroCard and replace it with a contactless system. This would be no small task; MTA would have to redesign its payment system to be account-based—allowing each passenger to maintain his or her own “digital payment account” — while installing near-field communications payment terminals and optical scanners throughout its network. Cubic Transportation Systems received a $500 million contract to build this system, which would ultimately be called OMNY (short for One Metro New York). 

>In March 2019, more than 12,000 readers were installed all over New York City's subway system and busses. Before its launch that March $85.4 million have been spent on the project, out of a total budget of $644.7 million. As of 2020, the budget has risen to $732 million by November 2020 and $772 million by June 2021.

## *Business Activities*

>As the world advances and fewer people use and carries cash, the subway system in New York City was the only system left behind, not to just compare it with the other FinTech innovations around the city but also with the rest of the world. OMNY is going to save time and make it easier to pay and never worry about refilling the MetroCard again, just tap and go. It is an easy way that can receive payments from smartphones, smartwatches, and credit cards that have the wireless payment option.

>The returning customers in a post-pandemic world started using public transportation again and finally, MTA was able to generate data about the traffic of public transportation use, a sector that was hit hard by the pandemic. In May 2021 MTA released the information that the NYC subway and bus rides reached a pandemic record high ridership of 2,239,500 contactless transactions in one single day. As of today speaking there are 472 subway stations and 5,800 MTA busses that offer the OMNY contactless payment to use public transportation in NYC.

>The technology applied to complete this project was already invented and was used by many companies. It first started with stores to prevent theft and then banks who created credit cards and reader devices, that have a chip into it with radio-frequency identification (RFID) which uses electromagnetic fields to automatically identify and track tags attached to objects. The RFID system has three main elements that can not run without *a tiny radio transponder*, *a radio receiver* and *transmitter*. The process starts when an electromagnetic interrogation pulse is triggered from a nearby RFID reader device, the tag transmits digital data known as identifying inventory numbers, back to the reader. This number is used to track inventory goods. In this case, this number will track the free transfer in the subways system for 2 hours. Passive tags are powered by energy from the RFID reader's interrogating **radio waves**. RFID is one method of **automatic identification and data capture (AIDC)**


## *Landscape*

>One of the largest domains of FinTech in terms of interest from investors is payments. Payment is about payment services including payment back-end infrastructure, card issuing, merchant acquiring, mobile payment, seamless solutions, and point of sales solutions. OMNY is in the domain of payments that can be considered as payment, back-end and infrastructure. 
This subdomain of payments can broadly refer to payment processing providers, solutions for accepting electronic payments, point of sale terminals, card providers, and also mobile payments. 

>*The Payment domain of FinTech*
>
>The last 20 years have shaped the world when it comes to how we pay for goods and services. It started with PayPal and WorldPay that kicked off the first wave of FinTech, making it easier for buyers and sellers to do business together on the internet and in person. This last decade has proven that we have been using digital payment services in almost 90% of our daily transactions thanx to RFID (radio-frequency identification) and mobile apps, the industry is projected to be worth $2 trillion by 2025.


## *Results*

>The OMNY system has transformed the industry completely, it is very modern and very convenient, plus it helps the planet by reducing the plastic waste of MetroCards. The MTA has said that more people take the subways now because it is easier to pay. On the other side, the MTA has improved the subway stations by installing other technologies like touch screens to check train departure and arrivals, also USB charging stations for phones and other devices to make the subways system more attractive for riders.   

>MTA sees an increase of riders using the system and that automatically generates more income which is a very important metric of success. The MTA Police also have reported that fewer people are committing turn-style jumping (not paying the fare) because now the payment method is so robust that people can just touch their devices instead of waiting to refill the MetroCard or in case of MetroCard's Vending Machine running out of power or not working at all *(which has been an issue for many years)*.

>In New York City the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) has a contract with Cubic Transportation System to develop and maintain the OMNY system, it is the only company that offers the service for contactless payment in the public transportation system in New York City. Compared to other industries the use of the contactless system has been increasing and now almost every store offers it.


## *Recommendations*

>>When I moved to New York City a few years ago I fell in love with it right away, it is the energy and the potential that this city generates. I found it fascinating how everything was connected and worked as a whole. Now, I live in New York and I work in Jersey City. I commute to work by train, but I have to switch between the NY Subway system and the New Jersey Path. I have been so disappointed when I figured out that OMNY doesn't work there, and not only that but doesn't recognize the transfer. I would highly recommend for them to apply that and figure it out because like me, a lot of riders that use both subway systems and collaboration would make it work as a whole.

>>I would highly also recommend for OMNY is to build a card that works just like credit cards where you can transfer money or have monthly unlimited rides that will be cheaper for heavy commuters and also offer plans for senior citizens and people with disabilities.

>>To make this happen MTA will need to build a user-friendly website where people can refill their cards and use them to commute and this way that will prevent exposure of credit cards in their daily activities.

>>It helps users and removes the need for a machine in the subways station where people wait in lines and most of the time they are not working or not easy to use for tourists and senior citizens.
